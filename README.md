## 📌 About
This project implements a **TensorFlow-powered machine learning model** capable of classifying **pedigree charts** into the following **genetic inheritance patterns**:
```bash
Inheritance Patterns
├── Autosomal
│   ├── Autosomal Dominant
│   └── Autosomal Recessive
├── X-Linked
│   ├── X-Linked Dominant
│   └── X-Linked Recessive
└── Y-Linked
    ├── Y-Linked Dominant
    └── Y-Linked Recessive
```

By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model learns to analyze and differentiate inheritance patterns from pedigree chart datasets. The pipeline is built in **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation and reproducibility.
